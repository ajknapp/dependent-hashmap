# dependent-hashmap

This is hash map library where the keys can specify the type of value that is associated with them with type indices.

This library is to
[dependent-map](https://github.com/mokus0/dependent-map) what `Data.HashMap.Lazy` is to `Data.Map`.

It's implemented as a thin wrapper around `Data.HashMap.Lazy`, and
has roughly the same interface.
